This repository contains the experiment data from the experiments on the Edge-Cloud architecture for AI Knowledge Management applications. The experiments test the computation and data transmission times of the different layers of the architecture. This data is used in the results shown in the paper.

## Contents
The repository consists in an excel spreadsheed that contains the results from the experiments. The experiments run an AI model for <a href="https:
//github.com/Giffy/AI_CarCrashDetector">car crash detection</a> and test network latency, inference time, and total time. The results are organized in tables per image size. Each image size table contains the execution time and data transmission times for the edge and cloud devices.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Excel, Open Office, Libre Office, Google Calc, or any text editor.

## Installation and use
Download the spreadsheet and open it with any spreadsheed software.

## Data
The data contained in this repository are the results of the experiments of the article.
